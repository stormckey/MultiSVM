# A Multi-class claasifier implemented by SVM

A course project of Data modeling and analysis. We are required to implement a multi-class classifier by SVM to classify MNIST. In addition, we need to use adaboost to improve the performance of the classifier.

I successfully implemented the classifier and got a 0.75 accuracy on the test set. The implementation includes kernel function and achieve the multi-class classification by one-vs-one method.(The rbf kernel seems to overfit and performs bad in the test set.)

However, I failed to implement adaboost. Let me know if you have any idea about it.
